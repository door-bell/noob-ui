# NoobUi

Some basic UI enhancements to help new players with basic minecraft concepts which are otherwise bespoke (hidden in debug menus, etc).

## Feature List
1. Coordinates, ping and FPS in the top left corner of the screen at all times.
2. Holding TAB highlights visible player and horse names to make it easier to find them when they are nearby (i.e. when you lose track of your friend in a cave).

## Dev Setup
For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the IDE that you are using.
